# Hello-World
This is a collection of small but useful scripts that I've worked on for different projects. I am sharing them as a tool for others to use.

**ConverToBMP.py:** A python scrip to convert colored images to 1-bit BMP format. The color palette is B/W and can be changed easily. Inspired from [this](https://github.com/kentoj/python-fundamentals/blob/master/bmp.py) and [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46388479).
